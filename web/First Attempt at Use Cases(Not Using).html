    <h3>Only being used as reference to "How not to do Use cases"</h3>

    <h2>Brief Use Cases</h2><br>
    <strong><i>Use case 1.0:</i></strong>Create a new Commander<br>

    </ol>

    <h2>What I Learned from the process above</h2>
    <strong>Learning curve</strong>
     <p>From the above process I learned that ‘my’ understanding of having to have a Brief, casual and<br>
        fully dressed Use Case for every Use Case was not the correct way to work through them.<br>

    <strong>Precondition</strong><br>
        What I learned from the above attempts was how to establish what a Precondition is, A <br>
        precondition is simply a starting point for the Use Case to begin at. Use case begins with<br>
        some conditions met).</p>

    <h2>Example of Use case with Precondition</h2>

        <strong><i>Withdrawer cash Use Case 1.0:</i></strong><br>
        <strong><i>Withdrawer cash</i></strong>Customer<br>
        <strong><i>Primary Actor:</i></strong><br>
        <strong><i>Precondition:</i></strong>Card details have been validated and cash is available to account holder.

            <ol>
                <li>The system presents the customer with Withdrawal Amount Screen</li>
                <li>The customer enters Withdrawal Amount .</li>
                <li>The system checks the withdrawal amount is not greater than the amount <br>
                    in the customer's account.</li>
                <li>If the Withdrawal Amount  is less than the amount being sought the system pays out the cash.</li>
                <li>The system updates the customer's account details.</li>
                <li>The system asks if another service is requested.</li>
                <li>The system resets. </li>
            </ol>
