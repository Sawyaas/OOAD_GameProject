    <h1>Use Case 6.0: Attack Another Base</h1>
    <strong><i>Primary Actor:</i></strong> Player<br />
    <strong><i>System under discussion:</i></strong> Turn Based Strategy Game "Last Whisper"<br />
    <strong><i>Level:</i></strong> Player Goal<br />
    <strong><i>Preconditions:</i></strong> The player is logged on, has started a new game or loaded a previous one
    and is on his base map<br />
    <strong><i>Basic Flow:</i></strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Player goes to the map</li>
        <li>Player selects the target base</li>
        <li>Player selects the Attack option</li>
        <li>
            System calculates the total Attack value of the Playerâ€™s army as the offensive side and the total
            Defence value of the target base as the defensive side
        </li>
        <li>
            System determines the winner by comparing the Attack value of the offensive side and the Defence value
            of the defensive side
            <ol>
                <li>
                    If the Attack value of the offensive side is at least 50% higher than the Defence value
                    of the defensive side then the offensive side automatically wins
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            System gives a random part of the resources and a random part of the remaining units of the winner side
            to the looser side
        </li>
        <li>System shows the final battle screen</li>
        <li>Player comes back to the updated map</li>
    </ol>

            5.1.a. If the Defence value of the defensive side is at least 50% higher than the Attack value
            of the offensive side then the defensive side automatically wins.
        </li>
        <li>
            5.1.b. If the Attack value of the offensive side is equals to the Defence value
            of the defensive side then System randomly determines the winner
        </li>
        <li>
            6.1 If the defensive side has lost then System sets the attacked base as destroyed
        </li>
    </ul>
