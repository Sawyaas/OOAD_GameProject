        <h1>Use Case 6.0: Attack Another Base</h1>
        <strong><i>Primary Actor:</i></strong> Player<br />
        <strong><i>System under discussion:</i></strong> Turn Based Strategy Game "Last Whisper"<br />
        <strong><i>Level:</i></strong> Player Goal<br />
        <strong><i>Preconditions:</i></strong> The player is logged on, has started a new game or loaded a previous one
        and is on his base map.<br />
        <strong><i>Postconditions:</i></strong> The armies and resources of the both sides are updated.
        If Player has won, the target base is destroyed and the map is updated.<br />
        <strong><i>Basic Flow:</i></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Player goes to the map.</li>
            <li>Player selects the target base.</li>
            <li>Player selects the attack option.</li>
            <li>
                System calculates the total attack value of the Playerâ€™s army as the offensive side and the total
                defence value of the target base as the defensive side.
            </li>
            <li>
                System determines the winner by comparing the attack value of the offensive side and the defence value
                of the defensive side.<br />
                If the attack value of the offensive side is at least 50% higher than the defence value
                of the defensive side then the offensive side automatically wins.
            </li>
            <li>
                System gives a random part of the resources and a random part of the remaining units of the losing side
                to the winning side.
            </li>
            <li>System shows the final battle screen.</li>
            <li>Player comes back to the updated map.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong><i>Alternative Flows:</i></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                5.a. If the defence value of the defensive side is at least 50% higher than the attack value
                of the offensive side then the defensive side automatically wins.
            </li>
            <li>
                5.b. If the attack value of the offensive side is equals to the defence value
                of the defensive side then System randomly determines the winner.
            </li>
            <li>
                6.1 If the defensive side has lost then System sets the attacked base as destroyed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong><i>Extensions:</i></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Player check information about a base.</li>
                    <li>Player comes back to the map.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
